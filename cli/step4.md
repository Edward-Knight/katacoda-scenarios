In the previous step we create directories inside the directory we were in.

We were doing this by specifying a name for that directory.  This name acts
as a relative path to the new directory.  You can create a directory inside a 
directory using this method too.

First, let's see where we are, and what is in the directory:

``pwd``{{execute}}

``ls``{{execute}}

Now we can create a directory *inside* ``test_folder``.  We can do this by 
moving into the folder and creating a new directory OR we an create the folder 
from where we are now!
