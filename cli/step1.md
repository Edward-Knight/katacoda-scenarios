The command line is case sensitive, so always type commands exactly as given. 
For more complex commands spaces are important as well, always include spaces!

A <strong>prompt</strong> will be displayed in the terminal window on 
the right.

Prompts will look slightly different on different systems but for this 
tutorial this will be:

`>`

To instruct your terminal to do something, you need to enter specific commands 
and press enter.  Let's try running the ``pwd`` command!
 
 ``pwd`` stands for:
 
 <strong>p</strong>resent 
 <strong>w</strong>orking 
 <strong>d</strong>irectory.  
 
This will tell you where you are in the filesystem.

`pwd`{{execute}}

Don't worry about running commands in this environment - you can't break 
anything here!

Try running a command that doesn't exist:

`hello`{{execute}}

You should get the following message telling you what you already know:

`bash: hello: command not found`


###Â Task

1) Find out which directory (folder) you are in currently: 


You should see the following output:
`/home/scrapbook/tutorial`
