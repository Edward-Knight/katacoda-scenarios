In this tutorial we will be learning how to open and search files.  We will be
concentrating on fastq files because who doesn't love bioinformatics? <3

For the uninitiated fastq is a popular format for storing DNA sequences. You 
can read about this format here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format


#### Note: 
Commands can be transcribed from the left to the terminal on the right or 
clicked.  

If clicked, the command will be run in the terminal on the right and 
you will see the results straight away.  

Always try to type these commands 
yourself as this will make it easier to get the hang of it!
