Like in tutorial 1, let's check where we are and what is in our directory;

`pwd`{{execute}}

`ls`{{execute}}

These commands should show that we are in:

`/home/scrapbook/tutorial`

And in this folder we have one file:

`sample.fastq`

This file will be what we will be practising opening during this tutorial.  The 
file is copied from the fastq example on wikipedia (see intro).

Let's read this file!  We will be using a program called `cat`.

`cat sample.fastq`{{execute}}

You will see that the file contains 5 reads which are suspiciously similar to 
one another (with the exception of the ID line).
