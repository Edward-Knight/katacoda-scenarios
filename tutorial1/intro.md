### Don't panic!

Don't worry about running any commands in this environment - you can't break 
anything here!


Commands can be transcribed from the left to the terminal on the right or 
clicked.  

If clicked, the command will be run in the terminal on the right and 
you will see the results straight away.  

Always try to type these commands 
yourself as this will make it easier to get the hang of it!

Things we will be covering:


* How to run **commands** in a **terminal window**
* What a **working directory** is
* Find out where you are in the filesystem (`pwd`)
* How to list the contents of a directory (`ls`)
* How to make a directory (`mkdir`)
* How to move into a new directory (`cd`)
* Briefly touch upon **absolute** and **relative** paths
