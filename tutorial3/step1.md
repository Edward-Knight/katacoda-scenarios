This tutorial will be covering what to do when you're faced with unfamiliar 
commands.  First though, let's review what we've learned from the commands 
we've already tried.  Like before, anywhere I write `<something>` what I'm 
saying is that part of the command depends on what you want to achieve e.g. 
which directory you wish to move to (`cd`) or what you want to name your 
directory (`mkdir`).

|Command|What it does|
|-----|------|
|`pwd`| prints working directory|
|`ls`| lists what is saved in your working directory (files and directories)|
|`ls \<path\> `| lists what is saved in \<path\> (files and directories)|
|`mkdir \<path\>` | makes a directory at \<path\>|
|`cd \<path\> `| changes your working directory to \<path\>|
|`less \<path\>` | opens the file \<path\> for reading|

What you might have noticed is that these follow a similar structure:

```
<command> <arguments / options>
```

Arguments and options can be anything you can type - numbers, letters, paths 
etc and customise the command you are running.
