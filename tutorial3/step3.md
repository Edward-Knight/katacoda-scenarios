Continuing to look through the `pwd` manpage let's go through this together.

```
NAME
pwd - print name of current/working directory
```

This is basically just telling us what we already know - that `pwd` will print 
your current/working directory.  Current directory is just another way 
or saying working directory so nothing new yet.

```
SYNOPSIS
pwd [OPTION]...
```
OK, this has some new conventions - what this is saying is that to run `pwd` 
you need to type `pwd` first followed by any arguments or options.
