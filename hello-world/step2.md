##### Where am I?
In the previous step we learned about ``pwd`` which tells us
which folder we are currently in.

##### Listing contents of directories
Next we will look at listing contents of directories

``ls``{{execute}}

You will see nothing returned - there is nothing!

##### Creating directories
Let's create some directories:

``mkdir my_data``{{execute}}

Now let's check the contents of ``pwd``

``ls``{{execute}}

Now you should see the folder ``my_data`` in your directory.

You can create a directory with any name you want by writing the following:

``mkdir <name_of_your_directory>``

Note: don't create directory names containing spaces!
